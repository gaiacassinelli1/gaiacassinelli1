## 🚀 About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast from Milan with a strong curiosity for how data shapes the world. I'm currently diving deep into the world of **Big Data**, **Data Science**, and **Solution Architecture** through an intensive ITS program. My goal? To design intelligent, data-driven systems that solve real-world problems.

When I'm not coding or exploring new technologies, you might find me:
- 📊 Experimenting with data visualizations
- ☁️ Learning about cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP 
- 🧠 Reading about AI, machine learning, and system design
- 🎧 Listening to tech podcasts or electronic music
